Description: FS1030 project - An Electronic Medical Record system for healthcare providers with authentication

Used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node, Express, MySQL

The project is to design an EMR system for the care providers through which a care provider, such as a family doctor, can:
1) Login
2) Search for patient using patient’s Health Card Number
3) View patient details
4) Update patient details
5) Write notes on patient details page – the notes should appear in reverse
chronological order. For example, if Doctor Abc has posted a note on 19-Apr2019 and Doctor Xyz has posted a note on 20-apr-2019 for the same patient.
The Doctor Xyz’s note would appear on the top.
6) The patient details page should also show the revision history for the patient
record. For example, if Doctor Abc has changed the patient address for a patient
named Peter Patterson, it should show up in the revision history as “Peter’s
address changed on 19-Apr-2019 by Dr. Abc” and so forth with latest revision at
the top.

Also, design a super admin interface where a super admin user would be able to:
1) Search/Create/Read/Update/Delete Patients - Ryan Legaspi
2) Search/Create/Read/Update/Delete Care Providers - Jen Beltran
3) Login authentication and password encryption - Jen Beltran
4) Database creation - Jen Beltran
